## Roundtable Discussion: Sponsorship for Small College Broadcasts

Join us for an informal roundtable discussion on securing sponsorships for small college broadcasts. This isn't a presentation with a set agenda; it's an open forum for sharing experiences, asking questions, and learning from your peers. Whether you've successfully landed sponsors, are just starting to explore options, or are facing unique challenges, this is your chance to connect with others in a similar position. Come prepared to share what works for you, brainstorm solutions to common hurdles, and discover new strategies for funding your broadcasts.

The event will take place in the [Athletic Communications Discord](/blog/discord), so if you haven't joined yet, please come on over.
