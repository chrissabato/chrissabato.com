## Athletic Communications Discord
### A space for athletics communicators to share ideas and ask questions

Like many of you, I've spent a lot of time in the sports information Facebook groups and on Twitter over the years. They've been great for asking questions, sharing knowledge, and just connecting with peers. But I've also noticed more and more people stepping away from those platforms lately.

It got me thinking about where we can all connect and support each other effectively. That's why I've created the Athletics Communications Discord as a new alternative space.

Discord is fantastic for building focused communities. It allows for more organized discussions through dedicated channels for different topics (like stats, gameday, etc.) and makes real-time connection, whether text or voice, really easy.

My hope is to bring together those who've left other platforms and those looking for a more dedicated community space. If we get enough engagement, I truly believe Discord can be an incredibly valuable hub for our profession.

It's a free and easy-to-use platform, and I think it could be a great home for our ongoing conversations and mutual support.

Come join us and help shape this new community!
