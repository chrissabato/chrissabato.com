Tools of the Trade is (hopefully) a regular Zoom meeting that stems from my desire for those in the college athletics communications and media fields to come together and talk about the technologies we use. We've all sat through presentations where someone talks at us about a topic. I want this to be different, participants should drive the converation. While the conversation will be moderated, the idea is that anyone present can contribute answers.

Participants can ask questions using the zoom Q&A. Anyone present who is knowledgeble can raise their hand and contribute to the answer. If participant numbers are small conversations will be more free flowing. If there is a large number of participants I will be more ridgid in monderation and moving things along.

These sessions will be most effective if attentees are full participants. For example have your camera on with good lighting. Use headphones and a good mic. Ask questions and give answeres if you have them.

**Wednesday, December 13 @ 12pm ET / 9am PT**
